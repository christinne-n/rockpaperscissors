This is a simple rock, paper, scissors game made to be played on the console. The user
will put their input and the computer will randomly respond with an answer to see who wins. 

Update (9/20):
This rock, paper, scissors game is made through the OdinProject guidelines. The user will
press on any of the 3 buttons to make their choice of rock, paper or scissors. The computer
will randomly generate a response, as the score is kept track of and a winner is determined
after 5 rounds of playing. A reset button is available to restart the game once completed.
